🌌 Solar System Explorer
Interactive 3D visualization of the Solar System using Three.js, enhanced with intuitive controls, tooltips, and a planet-centric "View" feature.

🚀 Features
Orbit simulation for Sun and eight planets, updated in real time.

Speed sliders to accelerate or pause individual planetary orbits.

👁 “View” button — jump camera to stand near any planet.

Dynamic backgrounds focused on the active planet.

Mouse controls: drag to rotate, scroll to zoom.

Tooltips display names & descriptions on hover.

Responsive design — adjusts layout for both desktop and mobile.

Minimal, self-contained code — standalone HTML + JS, no build tools required.

🧩 Demo
Open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

🧠 Usage Guide
Click Play/Pause to start or halt the animation.

Reset all speeds via Reset.

Drag sliders for each planet to tune orbit speed.

Click the 👁️ View button to relocate the camera near that planet.

Hover on a planet or Sun to read its tooltip.

Pan/rotate with mouse drag; zoom with the mouse wheel.

Mobile: use touch, drag, and pinch.

🔧 Code Structure
HTML/CSS — UI and layout; slider and button styling included.

SolarSystemApp class — handles initialization, scene setup, controls, UI events, render loop.

buildPlanets() creates planet meshes, control panel entries (slider + “View”).

setPlanetCameraView(planetName) positions camera near that planet.

Minimal modifications applied on top of the original Three.js template — no new dependencies.

⚙️ Setup & Customization
Clone or download the repo.

Edit planetSettings[] in the script to tweak planet size, color, orbit radius/speed, description.

No build step needed — just open in browser or host on a static server.
